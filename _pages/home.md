#### Our Research

We explore the impact of digital data on the future of fashion, particularly how digital input can improve the fit, design, and production of clothing. This encompasses a wide range of topics from pattern making to computer graphics to virtual reality and as such. We collaborate with academic units, companies and artist on projects related to body-garment relationships.

Our goal is to transform apparel design, product development, manufacturing, and retail by leveraging digital technologies to create an environmentally sustainable apparel industry. We approach every project with a commitment to methodologically rigorous, multidisciplinary, and ethical research using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We ensure our findings have practical implications for academia, industry, and society.

##### Key Areas of Focus
- Technologies for apparel technical design teams and training the future workforce  
- Tools and methods for virtual fit analysis
- Artificial intelligence for garment fit
- Virtual try-on and AR technologies for consumer use  
- Improving mass-produced clothing fit (including protective apparel) using anthropometric databases  
- Mass customization of clothing and understanding consumer interest in customization  

#### Our Facilities
The Cornell Fashion & Body Tech Lab is located in **Room 112, Human Ecology Building** on the Cornell University Ithaca campus. Our space is equipped with advanced tools for apparel research and teaching, including two [**3D body scanners**](https://www.bodyscan.human.cornell.edu/scene0037.html), virtual/augmented reality applications and more! These resources enable our team and collaborators to prototype, test, and evaluate innovative approaches to apparel design and production.
